# GEN Kovan Faucet

This project is an open source ERC20 compatible token faucet for the Kovan testnet.
We encourage you to go through the code and use it for your own ERC20 tokens.
To easily change the faucet to use your token, please go through all the ``TODO`` comments in the code and make the changes as described.

For further questions you are welcome to open an issue or make a PR.
